# GMTK 2023 entry

This is my entry to the GMTK Game Jam for 2023.
This is the first time in a while that I'm seriously trying to do game development.
As I'm a programmer, I've decided to focus on programming and general design.
I've put all third party assets in the `third_party/` folder.

**I am not a lawyer**.
Only the source code is explicitly covered under the GPL3 license.
I have no idea how this will interact with the art assets.
All art assets will be licensed under appropriate terms, so recording/playing the game should be fine.

## Third party assets

Here is a list of used third party assets, exclusively for your convenience:
