# GMTK 2023 entry

This is my entry to the GMTK Game Jam for 2023.
This is the first time in a while that I'm seriously trying to do game development.
As I'm a programmer, I've decided to focus on programming and general design.
I've put all third party assets in the `third_party/` folder.

This project is licensed under "GPL 3 or later".
This technically includes the third party assets,
although these are likely also available under a more permissive license.

## Third party assets

Here is a list of used third party assets, exclusively for your convenience:
